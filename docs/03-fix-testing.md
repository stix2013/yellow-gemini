### 1. Understanding the Goal

The objective is to diagnose and resolve any issues within the project's unit testing suite. The `package.json` file indicates that the `test` script specifically targets tests within the `tests/stores/` directory. Therefore, the primary goal is to ensure all Pinia store unit tests are functioning correctly, passing reliably, and accurately reflecting the current state of the application's logic.

### 2. Investigation & Analysis

A thorough investigation is necessary to understand the context and identify the root cause of any failures before attempting a fix.

*   **Identify Test Scope and Commands:**
    *   Read `package.json` to confirm the command associated with the `test` script. The script is `"test": "vitest run tests/stores/** --verbose"`, which confirms the focus is on the store tests.

*   **Review Testing Configuration:**
    *   Read `vitest.config.ts` to understand the environment and configuration for the unit tests. This will clarify how Vitest is set up to work with Nuxt and Pinia.

*   **Analyze Existing Test and Source Code:**
    *   Read the test file `tests/stores/locale.test.ts` to understand what is currently being tested and how. This includes the test structure, assertions, and any mocking that is in place.
    *   Read the corresponding store file `app/stores/locale.ts` to understand the logic that the test is intended to cover. This allows for a comparison between the implementation and the test's expectations.

*   **Execute the Tests (Simulated):**
    *   The most critical investigative step is to run the test command (`bun test`) to see the live output. This will provide the exact error messages, failure points, and stack traces needed for an accurate diagnosis.

*   **Critical Questions to Answer:**
    *   Are the tests failing? If so, what are the specific error messages?
    *   Do the tests accurately reflect the functionality of the `locale` store?
    *   Are the initial state, getters, and actions of the Pinia store being tested correctly?
    *   Is the test environment (`happy-dom`, `nuxt`) configured correctly in `vitest.config.ts` for testing Pinia stores?
    *   Have there been recent changes to the `locale` store that are not yet reflected in the tests?

### 3. Proposed Strategic Approach

The plan will be executed in a series of logical phases to ensure a methodical and effective resolution.

*   **Phase 1: Isolate the Environment**
    1.  Create a new Git branch, `fix/unit-tests`, to isolate all changes related to fixing the tests.

*   **Phase 2: Diagnosis and Root Cause Analysis**
    1.  Execute the `bun test` command to reproduce the failures.
    2.  Carefully analyze the output to identify the specific tests that are failing and the reasons for the failures.
    3.  Compare the logic in `tests/stores/locale.test.ts` with the implementation in `app/stores/locale.ts` to find any discrepancies in expectations versus reality.

*   **Phase 3: Implementation of Fixes**
    1.  Address the identified issues systematically. This could involve:
        *   Correcting incorrect assertions in the test file.
        *   Updating the test to reflect recent changes in the store's logic.
        *   Refactoring the test to properly use helpers from `@pinia/testing` if they are not already in use.
        *   Ensuring the Pinia store is correctly instantiated in the test setup.
    2.  After each significant change, re-run the tests to get immediate feedback and ensure the fix is effective.

*   **Phase 4: Documentation**
    1.  Create the file `docs/03-fix-testing.md`.
    2.  Document the investigation findings, the nature of the problem, the steps taken to fix it, and any recommendations for future unit tests.

### 4. Verification Strategy

*   **Successful Test Execution:** The primary measure of success is the `bun test` command completing successfully with all tests in the suite passing.
*   **No Regressions:** After fixing the unit tests, run the E2E test suite (`bun test:e2e`) to ensure that the changes have not inadvertently introduced any regressions in the application's overall behavior.
*   **Code Review:** The changes should be reviewed to ensure they adhere to the project's coding standards and testing best practices.

### 5. Anticipated Challenges & Considerations

*   **Obsolete Tests:** The tests may be failing because the functionality they were testing has been changed or removed. The task might involve updating or deleting obsolete tests rather than just fixing them.
*   **Mocking Complexity:** If the store has dependencies on other modules or services (e.g., API calls), they will need to be mocked correctly. Improper mocking can lead to unreliable tests.
*   **Test Environment Issues:** The problem might not be in the test code itself but in the configuration of the test environment. Debugging `vitest` or `happy-dom` configuration can be complex.
*   **Incomplete Test Coverage:** The existing tests might not be comprehensive. While the primary goal is to fix existing tests, it would be prudent to note any critical logic that is not currently covered by tests and recommend adding them in a future task.

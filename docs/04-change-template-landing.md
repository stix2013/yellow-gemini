### 1. Understanding the Goal

The objective is to completely overhaul the application's current homepage and replace it with a new design based on the official Nuxt UI "Landing" template. The final implementation should closely mirror the structure, components, and aesthetic of the live preview available at `https://landing-template.nuxt.dev/`.

### 2. Investigation & Analysis

A thorough investigation is required to understand the components of the target template and how they will integrate into the existing project structure.

*   **Analyze the Target Template:**
    *   Use the `web_fetch` tool on the template's documentation page (`https://ui.nuxt.com/templates/landing`) to extract critical information. This will include:
        *   The names of the specific Nuxt UI components used (e.g., `ULandingHero`, `UPageGrid`, `ULandingCard`).
        *   The required project dependencies (e.g., `@nuxt/ui`, `@nuxt/fonts`).
        *   The necessary configuration in `app.config.ts` for colors, fonts, and component defaults.
        *   The basic structural layout of the page's components.

*   **Assess the Current Project State:**
    *   **Dependencies:** Read `package.json` to confirm that `@nuxt/ui` is installed and to identify if any other required packages (like `@nuxt/fonts`) are missing.
    *   **Configuration:**
        *   Read `nuxt.config.ts` to see how `@nuxt/ui` is currently registered.
        *   Check for the existence of `app.config.ts`. If it exists, read it to understand the current UI configuration. If not, one will need to be created.
    *   **Existing Structure:**
        *   Read `app/pages/index.vue` to have a clear picture of the content that will be replaced.
        *   Read `app/layouts/default.vue` to analyze the current default layout. The landing page template likely provides its own full-page structure, which may require the existing layout's header and footer to be removed or a new, clean layout to be created.
        *   Read `app/app.vue` to understand how the root component is structured and how layouts are applied.

### 3. Implementation Details

The implementation was structured in phases, starting with configuration and moving through component-by-component implementation.

*   **Phase 1: Setup and Configuration**
    1.  **Branching:** Created a new Git branch named `feat/landing-page-redesign`.
    2.  **Dependency Check:** Ensured `@nuxt/ui` and `@nuxt/fonts` are installed. Installed `@nuxt/fonts` as it was missing.
    3.  **Configuration:** Modified `app.config.ts` to define the color palette (primary: 'green', gray: 'cool') to match the landing page template's design.
    4.  **Layout Strategy:** Created a new layout file, `app/layouts/landing.vue`, that contains only a `<slot />`.

*   **Phase 2: Rebuilding the Homepage**
    1.  **Clear the Canvas:** Completely cleared the existing content of `app/pages/index.vue`.
    2.  **Structure the Page:** Set the `definePageMeta` to use the new `landing` layout.
    3.  **Implement Header:** Re-created the template's header section using the `UHeader` component.
    4.  **Implement Hero Section:** Built the main "Hero" section using the `UPageHero` component.
    5.  **Implement Features Section:** Constructed the grid of features using `UPageGrid` and `UPageCard` components.
    6.  **Implement Pricing Section:** Added a pricing section using `UPricingPlans` and `UPricingPlan` components.
    7.  **Implement Testimonials Section:** Added a testimonials section using `UPageGrid` and `UCard` components.
    8.  **Implement FAQ Section:** Added a FAQ section using the `UAccordion` component.
    9.  **Implement Footer:** Add the `UFooter` component at the bottom of the page.
    10. **Populate with Content:** Used the text and assets from the official template as placeholders.
    11. **Asset Management:** Created a placeholder `icon.svg` in the `public/` directory.

*   **Phase 3: Updating Tests**
    1.  **Analyze E2E Failures:** Ran the E2E test suite (`bun test:e2e`) and it failed as expected.
    2.  **Update E2E Test:** Modified `tests/e2e/index.spec.e2e.ts` to reflect the new landing page. The test now checks for the hero title, the presence of the "Get Started" button, and the existence of the new sections (features, pricing, testimonials, and FAQ).

### 4. Verification Strategy

*   **Visual Parity:** The new homepage is visually similar to the official Nuxt UI Landing template preview.
*   **Responsiveness:** The page is fully responsive across multiple viewport sizes.
*   **Interactivity:** All interactive elements, such as buttons and links in the header and footer, are functional.
*   **Passing Tests:** The entire test suite, including the updated E2E test, passes successfully.

### 5. Conclusion

The landing page has been successfully redesigned using the Nuxt UI template. The implementation is complete, tested, and merged into the main branch.

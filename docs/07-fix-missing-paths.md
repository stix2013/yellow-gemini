### 1. Understanding the Goal

The primary objective is to identify and rectify any "missing paths" within the Nuxt application. This involves discovering routes that are linked to but do not have corresponding pages. For each of these missing paths, a new page should be created. These new pages must adopt the existing `landing` layout, ensuring they have the same header and footer as the main landing page. The final plan should be documented in `docs/07-fix-missing-paths.md`.

### 2. Investigation & Analysis

To formulate a robust strategy, a thorough investigation of the current codebase is necessary. The following steps will be taken:

*   **Identify Existing Routes:** I will use the `list_nuxt_pages` tool to get a definitive list of all pages and routes that are currently implemented in the application. This will serve as our baseline of what exists.
*   **Analyze the Landing Layout:** I will read the contents of `app/layouts/landing.vue` to understand its structure, specifically how the header and footer are implemented and what components they use.
*   **Find All Internal Links:** I will perform a global search across the project for all instances of `<NuxtLink>` to identify all internal navigation links. This will tell us where the application intends to route users.
*   **Cross-Reference Links and Routes:** I will compare the list of identified links against the list of existing routes. Any link that does not correspond to an existing route will be considered a "missing path."
*   **Examine Error Handling:** I will look for a custom `app/error.vue` file to understand how the application currently handles 404 Not Found errors. This will provide insight into the current user experience for missing pages.

### 3. Proposed Strategic Approach

The plan will be executed in the following phases:

*   **Phase 1: Discovery & Identification**
    *   Execute `list_nuxt_pages` to catalog all existing routes.
    *   Read `app/layouts/landing.vue` to understand the target layout.
    *   Search the codebase for `<NuxtLink>` to find all internal links.
    *   Compile a list of paths that are linked to but do not exist.

*   **Phase 2: Scaffolding New Pages**
    *   For each missing path identified in Phase 1, a new page will be scaffolded using the `nuxt_scaffold` tool with the `page` template.
    *   The new pages will be created in the `app/pages` directory.
    *   The file names will correspond to the missing paths.

*   **Phase 3: Layout and Content**
    *   Each newly created page will be explicitly configured to use the `landing` layout. This will be done by adding the following script setup to each new `.vue` file:
        ```vue
        <script setup lang="ts">
        definePageMeta({
          layout: 'landing',
        });
        </script>
        ```
    *   Placeholder content will be added to each new page to indicate that it is a valid page. For example:
        ```vue
        <template>
          <div>
            <h1>This is the [Page Name] page.</h1>
            <p>Content for this page is coming soon.</p>
          </div>
        </template>
        ```

*   **Phase 4: Documentation**
    *   The entire strategic plan will be saved to `docs/07-fix-missing-paths.md`.

### 4. Verification Strategy

To ensure the successful implementation of this plan, the following verification steps should be taken:

*   **Build and Run:** The application should be built and run locally to ensure that the new pages have been correctly integrated and do not cause any build errors.
*   **Manual Navigation:** Manually navigate to each of the newly created pages to verify that they render correctly.
*   **Layout Verification:** Confirm that each new page correctly displays the header and footer from the `landing` layout.
*   **E2E Testing:** Run the existing end-to-end tests to ensure that the changes have not introduced any regressions in existing functionality.
*   **Link Checking:** Manually click on the links that were previously broken to ensure they now route to the correct new pages.

### 5. Anticipated Challenges & Considerations

*   **Ambiguity of "Missing Paths":** The term "missing paths" is somewhat ambiguous. This plan assumes it refers to broken internal links. If it refers to a predefined list of desired pages, that list would need to be provided.
*   **Dynamic Routes:** The investigation may uncover dynamic routes (e.g., `/users/[id]`). The plan will need to account for how to handle these, as they may not be simple static pages. For now, the focus will be on static paths.
*   **Content for New Pages:** The plan proposes using placeholder content. A separate task will be required to populate these pages with meaningful content.
*   **Layout Compatibility:** There is a small risk that the `landing` layout may have dependencies or assumptions that are not met by the new pages. This will need to be tested during the verification phase.

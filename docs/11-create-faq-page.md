### 1. Understanding the Goal

The primary objective is to create a new "Frequently Asked Questions" (FAQ) page accessible at the `/faq` route. This involves two main tasks: creating the page component itself and updating the main application header to include a navigation link to this new page.

### 2. Investigation & Analysis

Before any implementation, a thorough investigation of the existing codebase is required to ensure the new feature aligns with the project's conventions and structure.

*   **Analyze Existing Page Structure:** I will start by examining the `app/pages/` directory to understand how pages are constructed. I will read the contents of `app/pages/about.vue` and `app/pages/getting-started.vue` to understand the component structure, layout usage, and data fetching patterns.
*   **Examine Routing:** Nuxt uses a file-based routing system. I will confirm that creating a new `.vue` file in the `app/pages` directory will automatically generate the corresponding route.
*   **Inspect the Header Component:** I will read the file `app/components/AppHeader.vue` to determine how navigation links are managed. I will search for an array or object that defines the links, their labels, and their destination paths.
*   **Identify UI Components and Styling:** I will review `app.config.ts`, `nuxt.config.ts`, and existing components to identify the UI library in use (which is Nuxt UI) and the established styling conventions (likely Tailwind CSS). This will ensure the new page is visually consistent with the rest of the application.
*   **Review Testing Strategy:** I will analyze the `test/` directory, specifically `test/e2e/index.spec.e2e.ts` and `test/nuxt/AppHeader.spec.ts`, to understand the existing testing framework (`vitest`, `@nuxt/test-utils`) and patterns for both end-to-end and component testing.

### 3. Proposed Strategic Approach

The implementation will be broken down into the following phases:

*   **Phase 1: Create the FAQ Page Component**
    1.  Create a new file: `app/pages/faq.vue`.
    2.  Based on the structure of existing pages, create a basic Vue component with a `<template>` and `<script setup>` section.
    3.  Use the default layout unless a more specific one is required.
    4.  Add a main heading, such as "Frequently Asked Questions".
    5.  Use Nuxt UI components like `UAccordion` or a combination of `UCard`s to structure the FAQ content, ensuring a clean and interactive user experience. Initially, this will be populated with placeholder content.

*   **Phase 2: Update the Header Navigation**
    1.  Modify the `app/components/AppHeader.vue` file.
    2.  Locate the data structure that holds the navigation links.
    3.  Add a new object to this structure for the FAQ page, for example: `{ label: 'FAQ', to: '/faq' }`.

*   **Phase 3: Populate FAQ Content**
    1.  Replace the placeholder content in `app/pages/faq.vue` with the actual questions and answers for the FAQ.

### 4. Verification Strategy

To ensure the feature is implemented correctly and without regressions, the following verification steps should be taken:

*   **Component Testing:**
    *   Update the component test for `AppHeader` (`test/nuxt/AppHeader.spec.ts`) to assert that the "FAQ" navigation link is rendered.

*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    *   Create a new E2E test file: `test/e2e/faq.spec.e2e.ts`.
    *   This test should perform the following actions:
        1.  Visit the homepage.
        2.  Click on the "FAQ" link in the header.
        3.  Verify that the URL is now `/faq`.
        4.  Assert that the heading "Frequently Asked Questions" is visible on the page.
        5.  Confirm that the FAQ content (e.g., the accordion or cards) is rendered.

*   **Manual Verification:**
    *   Run the development server using `bun dev`.
    *   Manually navigate the site to check for the new "FAQ" link and page, ensuring it looks and functions as expected across different screen sizes.

### 5. Anticipated Challenges & Considerations

*   **FAQ Content:** The plan assumes that the content for the FAQ page will be provided. If not, placeholder content will be used, and the final content will need to be added later.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** The project contains a `locale.ts` store, which implies that multi-language support might be a requirement. The "FAQ" label in the header and all the content on the FAQ page itself may need to be integrated with the i18n system.
*   **Dynamic Content:** If the FAQ content needs to be fetched from a CMS or an API, the `useAsyncData` composable should be used, and the page structure will need to accommodate loading and error states. For this initial plan, static content is assumed.
*   **Component Reusability:** If the FAQ list is expected to be complex, it might be beneficial to create a dedicated `FaqItem.vue` component to be used within the main `faq.vue` page for better maintainability.

# Strategic Plan: Upgrade happy-dom to ^18.0.1

## 1. Understanding the Goal

The primary objective is to upgrade the `happy-dom` package from its current version (`14.12.3`) to the latest major version (`^18.0.1`). This upgrade is necessary to leverage new features, performance improvements, and security patches, while ensuring the existing test suite remains robust and reliable.

## 2. Investigation & Analysis

Before any code is modified, a thorough investigation is required to understand the potential impact of the upgrade. The following steps will be taken:

*   **Branch Creation:** A new git branch named `feat/upgrade-happy-dom` will be created to isolate the upgrade process.
*   **Dependency Audit:** The `package.json` file will be examined to confirm the current version of `happy-dom` and to identify any other packages that might have a dependency on it.
*   **Usage Analysis:** The entire codebase will be searched for all occurrences of `happy-dom` to understand how and where it is being used. This will likely include test configuration files like `vitest.config.ts` and `vitest.config.e2e.ts`.
*   **Configuration Review:** The Vitest configuration files (`vitest.config.ts`, `vitest.config.e2e.ts`) will be read to understand how `happy-dom` is integrated into the testing environment.
*   **Breaking Changes Research:** The official `happy-dom` release notes and changelogs will be reviewed to identify any breaking changes between version 14 and version 18. This is the most critical step to anticipate the scope of required code modifications.

## 3. Proposed Strategic Approach

The upgrade process will be broken down into the following phases:

*   **Phase 1: Dependency Upgrade & Initial Assessment:**
    1.  Modify the `package.json` file to update the `happy-dom` version to `^18.0.1`.
    2.  Run `bun install` to update the `bun.lock` file and install the new package version.
    3.  Execute the entire test suite (`bun test`). It is expected that tests will fail. The output of this initial run will provide a baseline of the work required.

*   **Phase 2: Code Remediation:**
    1.  Based on the test failures and the research on breaking changes, systematically address the issues. This may involve updating test setup, modifying test assertions, or adapting to new APIs introduced in the later versions of `happy-dom`.
    2.  This phase will be iterative. After each significant change, the relevant tests will be re-run to ensure the fix is effective.

*   **Phase 3: Full Regression Testing & Cleanup:**
    1.  Once all tests are passing, a full regression test will be performed by running the entire test suite again.
    2.  Any temporary code, comments, or `console.log` statements introduced during the remediation phase will be removed.
    3.  The code will be linted to ensure it adheres to the project's coding standards.

## 4. Verification Strategy

The success of the upgrade will be verified by the following criteria:

*   **Test Suite:** All unit and end-to-end tests must pass successfully.
*   **Linting:** The code must pass all linting checks without any errors or warnings.
*   **Functionality:** While not directly testable by this plan, the ultimate goal is that the application's functionality remains unchanged and no regressions are introduced.

## 5. Anticipated Challenges & Considerations

*   **Significant Breaking Changes:** The jump from version 14 to 18 is substantial, and there are likely to be significant breaking changes that will require considerable effort to address.
*   **Test Fragility:** The existing tests might be tightly coupled to the old version of `happy-dom`, requiring them to be rewritten or significantly refactored.
*   **Dependency Conflicts:** There is a small risk that the new version of `happy-dom` could have conflicts with other dependencies in the project.
*   **Time Estimation:** The time required to complete this upgrade is uncertain and will depend on the number and complexity of the breaking changes.
